# Reddit Subscriber Checker

This project includes a Python script that queries the Reddit API to find out the number of subscribers for a given subreddit.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have `requests` installed:

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Run the script using:

    ```bash
    ./0-subs.py <subreddit_name>
    ```

    Replace `<subreddit_name>` with the name of the subreddit you want to check.
